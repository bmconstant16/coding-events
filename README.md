# coding-events1

Purpose
This app allows users to create new events, add a description, assinging a category, and tags. It also allows users to create new categories and tags to link them to events. 

Current state
This app is currently running, but the foreign key table for the many to many relationship between the tags and events class is not populating

Future improvements
A Person class will be added that includes a username, first and last name, and location. The person class will be linked to event tags and events in order to find 
groups of interest by tag and also to save/link evnets to a particular user. Eventually, a location feature will be added to show events by location or those that are near the Person's
location entered in that class.
